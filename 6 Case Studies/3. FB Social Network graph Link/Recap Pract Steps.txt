Recap Pract Steps

NOTE :-
-> Some files are preprocessed & given
-> some states are saved & provided inorder to avoid computational complexity

=> In Graph Based ML Tasks, Featurization is the MIMP task

EDA :-
  helps to analyze the stats & also to create negative samples for out classif task
  Negative samples = mising link between 2 users
  Positive samples = present link between 2 users

Featurization :-
 -> Helps to create vector repr for each sample
    because with just samples we cant do ML,
    We need some dimensions or vector representation of our sample (ie Pair of User)

We create DiGraph based on Train Data but
Test Data may containes some new Persons which may not be seen in Train Data (Graph)
  \
   So for such new people we dont have clue regarding their social connections

  CSV Data -> Graph Data Object (via Network X)

  We need to add some data points with not having edges to balance the data set (train)


* Featurization :

  SVD :
  -> Adjacecy Matrix can be helpful to arrive at SVD for users pairs

     Because in our case we have User's Pairs
     Now
     One User can have multiple other users as opponent
     So For single user (= Row)
        Other Users forms a Column in Adj Matrix Representation

  SVD based vec-repr value

    - via SVD of User-User Adj-Matrix, we can have 2 k-dimen vec repr for each user

    What is User-User Adj Matrix
     - For each user we can show vector representing info about edge existence with all other users in
       the graph

     Now #users in graph is very large so repr this info consumes long sparse dimen vector for each user
     Hence
     We can use SVD to consolidate this info in smaller dimen via obtaining 2 k-dimen vector
     (k is rank in SVD)

     & then manipulating this 2 vectors to get some derived feature value)
            \
             Manipulation Eg :- Cosine Dist between these 2 vectros (ie Dot Product )

  * SVD :
  ---
  For any item, we have
  1) k-dimen from Left Singular Matrix  (ROW_i)
  2) k-dimen from right Sinular Matrix as well (COL_i)

  hence we have double info (ie 2 k-dimen vec)

  This gives us 2 representation of single entity
