1.1 Graph Terminologies
--------------------

-> In this Case studies we use only directed graph

=> Graph is set of vertices & edges

* Vertex :

* Edges/Links :  (Pair of 2 vertices)
    - Friendships
    - Followers/Followee

  Directed & UnDirected Edges
  ---
  -> used esp for follow/followee

* DAG : Directed Graph

* Path : sequence of valid edges (from src to dest)
