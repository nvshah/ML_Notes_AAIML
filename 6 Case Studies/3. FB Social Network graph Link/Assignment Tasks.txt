Assignment Tasks

1) Featurization : Preferential Attachment (ie Score Val based on InDegrees of Users-Pair)

2) Featurization : SVD based vec-repr value

    - via SVD of User-User Adj-Matrix, we can have 2 k-dimen vec repr for each user

    What is User-User Adj Matrix
     - For each user we can show vector representing info about edge existence with all other users in
       the graph

     Now #users in graph is very large so repr this info consumes long sparse dimen vector for each user
     Hence
     We can use SVD to consolidate this info in smaller dimen via obtaining 2 k-dimen vector
     (k is rank in SVD)

     & then manipulating this 2 vectors to get some derived feature value)
            \
             Manipulation Eg :- Cosine Dist between these 2 vectros (ie Dot Product )

    => We will get 2 k-dimen repr of Graph vertex i via SVD

     So for Pair there will be all in all 12*2 = 24 dimen vector // 6+6 dimen for each user

REMEMBER :
  * SVD :
  ---
  For any item, we have
  1) k-dimen from Left Singular Matrix  (ROW_i)
  2) k-dimen from right Sinular Matrix as well (COL_i)

  hence we have double info (ie 2 k-dimen vec)

  This gives us 2 representation of single entity
