Classification Task :- for Malware from 9 categories

REMEMBER :-
Multi Class Log Loss is very sensitive to probability values,
 Hence we are considering Multi-class Log Loss (as we have 9 target classes)

Data :-

For every malware (ie Data Point)
 \
  -we have 2 source of info :
   1) asm file
   2) bytes file


Featurization (For Byte Files)

 1. First we remove starting address of each byte file
 2. We convert Byte files into text files (Same hexadecimal repr but in .txt extension) & without starting long address
