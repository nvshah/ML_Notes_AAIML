1. Calibration Rvamp (gist)


Let f(Xq) = Yq`
Now this Yq` need not to be exact probability every time
So When we want the Exact or most appropriate probabilities, idea of Calibration Crops in !


* Calibration is a stage in Model prep, where
  given that you have already trained the model
  & You want to calibrate it S.T. You get actual probabilities of classes 1 & classes 2


* Calibration :
  ---
  is about finding confidence in our prediction

  i.e let say model predicts the probability of 0.8
  then often 80% of time it turns to 1
  Now
  Calibration will test how often does this is true (exactly)

  So we want to know what will be probability that it will be exactly p given that
  query point & its probabilistic prediction output
