Que General

Q Why we tends more towards Gaussian Distribution ??
-> because we know it as theoritical model with some known properties & facts


Q What is purpose of T distb ??
-> It's meant for small sized sample when std-dev is not known

Q). while Calculating Standard Deviation for Samples, There Instead of n, They Used n-1..Can you Explain Why?
-> It is related to Bessel's correction refer

Q) What is a Normal Vector
   -> A vector that is normal to a plane is known as the normal vector.
      In a simple way, let us consider earth as a plane(In reality earth is a curvature)
      then every cell phone tower which is placed at exactly 90 degrees with the plane is known as normal vector
      to the earth.

Q) Why W is Perpendicular to HyperPlane ??

   -> We have to assume 'W' to be perpendicular to the hyperplane
      because a hyperplane can be represented only in terms of a vector that is perpendicular to it.
