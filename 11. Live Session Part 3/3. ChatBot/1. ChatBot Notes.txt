* Design Choices :

1. Automated Que-Ans System with Large Text-Corpus (like Wikipedia)
   Domain Specific Automated Q&A

   - Here large amount of data avail, we need to train model & then ans que based on trained model

2. Information Retrieval Type of ChatBots
   - Question Pair Similarity Kinda Stuf

   In Google Search also when you ask some que, there is some internal techniqye
   to find similar questions behind the scenes

   - Here we need to try to find similar query & then reply accordingly

3. Flow Chart Based System

   - Most popular & widely used chatbots
   - IVR's are also Flowchart based system
       \
        User can inp via numeric Keypad (ie 1, 2, 3 )

   - Instead of numeric pad, Speech can also be used (ie Glorified IVRs)


* End-to-End Conversational Engines :
  -----
  -> 2 Metrics : F1 Score & Exact Match

  - Is the ans given by my BOT is exact same as Human Given Ans

  SQuaD
   - Paragraph & Question-Ans

  > BERT
  ------
   - For images we can do transfer learning (from Inception, ResNet ) Kinda Network
     Is there something equivalent available for text

* Info-Retrieval :
  ---
   - Question-Ans System
      LSTM based , Bi-dir LSTM

* Flow-Chart based ChatBot :
  ----
  - Simple to Design them
  - There are many tools

  -> DialogFlow (Google's Flowchat based ChatBot System)
      - Google NLP is very strong (so it suits bets with DialogFlow)

  -> RASA
      - Gives complete control
      - internally used Spacy, NLTK

=> Most usecases dont need Advance algorithm as they just follow a simple flowchat.

  Terms :

  1. Intent
  2. Actions

* Named Entity Recognition
  ----
  - It's a NLP task
  - Uses LSTM

  LSTM is standard technique for NLP today (compare to CRF (conditional Random Fields), or Hiden Markov Model)


* Dialog Control :

  Context Stack :- similar to call-stack of programming
    - here contextual of Chatbot conv is considered


* BlackBox & WhiteBox Testing
  --------------------
  BlackBox :- only concerns inp & output
  WhiteBox :- get into code inside between inp & out
