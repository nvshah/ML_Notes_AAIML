Doubt

Q) Does Gradient Descent is one of the case of Langrange Multiplier ?


Q) Does it is possible that via Gradient Descent the the variable val is changing very slightly
   after 100 iterations
   But later as we continue the iterations
   It again start changing drastically (let say after 150 iterations) once again !
