2. ML DL Technique
------------------
6.7 Which ML/DL techniqye to use where ??

-> Pick Technique as per need (ie No Favorite technique)

----------------

Q1) Text classif & Multi-Class Classif :
    ---
    We use TFIDF for vectorization

    q. Why KNN not works ?
     -> because of TFIDF, we have many classes & we are operating in high dimen space
        & In High dimen spaces KNN for such case may not work well

    q. Text data works well with Naive Bayes ??
      -> because Naive bayes works well in High dimen data (good baseline model)

    q. Why Logistic Reg ?
      -> works well in High Dimen

    => Instead of Simple Logistic Regression, We will use Softmax Classifer
       because
       Logistic Reg works only for binary & for multi we need to do One vs Rest
       Now
       Inorder to avoid One vs Rest we use Softmax Classifier (ie that will do multi-class classif for us)

    q. Why DT not work ?
       -> Decision Tree wont work on high dimen data !

    => For Feature Eng Purpose we can use technique like (SOTA)
       BERT,
       GPT

    q. Why not SVM ?

       -> use Softmax Classif than SVM

Q1.1) Naive Bayes vs Softmax Classif ??
-----
  -> NB :- make assumption (conditional Independent)
     Softmax Classif :- Just Linear Classifier in High Dimen space


----

Q2) Lots of unlabelled text data & we want to extract insights from it ?

   Ans. BERT + Clustering + Manual Analysis (Manual Labelling)

   -> BERT-Vec  // for encoding
     (In compare to Word2Vec, BERT-Vectorizers are better)

   Techniques
   ->
     Clustering (Hierarchical)

   * Topic Modelling (LDA)
   -----
   -> LDA techniques are no more powerful
   -> You can do topic Modelling with Deep Learning techniques

   * Summarization :
   ----
   - is not easy for entore text data
   - But you can summarize the cluster individually

   * WordCloud is another idea
   -----
   - another good viz approach
   - very impactful in biz context

   - alternative : "TSNE-Viz"

   * Sentiment Analysis :
   ----
   - Aspects
      \
       What each cluster is all about
       For Eg 1 Cluster : Battery Life (related comments)

     -> Aspects are actually discovered through clustering


------------

Q3) Find outliers in Time Series Data ??
    Eg Sale of Product for Stores over time period, need to find outliers in this !

    -> You can use RANSAC to make more Robust model
       You can apply RANSAC on top of your core model

    -> Ransac can make robust model, It cannot train model for you
       So if you have too many outliers use RANSAC


Q4) Speech ?

    - HMM
    - LSTM
    - Transformer // Recent SOTA (More used)


Q5) Images ?

    - CNN
    - FewShot Learnings
    - ImageNet Training - Transfer learning
    - Skip Connection (CNN)
    - Efficient Net
    - Vision Transformers

    - Obj Detection
