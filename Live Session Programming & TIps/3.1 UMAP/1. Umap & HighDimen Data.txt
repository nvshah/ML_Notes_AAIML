Umap & HighDimen Data
---------------------

-> UMAP for Visualizing High Dimen Data

-> Umap is SOTA

=> With TSNE the major drawback is number of experiment you need to do & put more time efforts
   inorder to get better mappings / results

_________________


- It overcome problem/drawback of TSNE

* TSNE Drawbacks
  - Non-Deterministic
  - takes a lot of time
  - doesnt preserve the global structure well

-> Umap can avoid some of the drawbacks of TSNE & not all

Perplexity := #neighbors whose distance we want to preserve

* TSNE : (Recap)
  ----
  - Neighborhood Preservation System

* Maths (Research Paper) :

  Q. What is the probability that Xj & Xi are the neighbors ?

  - RBF Kernel / Normalizer


  Pij -> High dimen space
  Qij -> 2 dimen space

* To measure difference between 2 Distribution :- KL Divergence

  - If Pij is larger I am giving more weightage to preserve the similarities
    &
    If Pij is smaller I am giving less weightage to preserve the similarities between Pi & Pj


For Pij := It uses Gaussian Kernel
    Qij := It uses T Distributed Kernel with Degree of Freedom  = 1



*----------------

* UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation & Projection)
------------
- topology perspective
  algorithmic specific

Assumption :
  - Points lie on (manifold) surface & at a uniform distance from one another

* UMAP Algorithm
  -----------

  1. For all pts, find nearest neighbors (k)
  2. Build a Graph using Xi's
  3. Using Optimization Framework, Find similar graph

=> When considering KNN, if distance is large in a group, then TSNE wont regards it
   but
   Despite of distance if its neighbor then UMPA will try to preserve it !

=> Though the distance may be very large (ie Weight of an edge less),
   where TSNE doesnt preserve
   but UMAP will tends to preserve in such case for given K (under K neighbors)

   Thus UMAP would preserve the neighbors even if distance is large

* Min-Dist :
  ----
  -> Providing some room or freedom to spread or increase gap, whilst projecting into lower dimen space

  -> How much far you can go while preserving the distance, whilst going from n dimen to d dimen (ie lower)

  -> Points which are closer (in original dimen)
     We are allowing to go far from original gap (ie to spread apart but max upto {min_dist})

 => UMAP better preserves global structure
    (ie Inter-Cluster distance are being tried to preserved well in case of UMAP)

NOTE :

-> While you can get Global Preservation with TSNE, the time it takes is large
   (& very high perplexity value)
   whereas
   UMAP attempts the same in lesser time


-> UMAP is faster because it accounts Edges


* HyperParameters :
  a. #neighbors
  b. min-dist


* Non-Deterministic :
-----------------
=> All the Optimization under TSNE & UMAP, are mostly Convex so they have
   multiple optima
   Therefor its Not a Deterministic
