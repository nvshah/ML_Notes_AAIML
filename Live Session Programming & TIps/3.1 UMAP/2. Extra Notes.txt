2. Extra Notes
------------

* TSNE (Optimization) :- Barns Hut
  UMAP (Optimization) :- Graph Optimization

* TSNE vs UMAP

  Perplexity <-> Neigbors

  -> In UMAP, lot of seprability can be seen
  -> In UMAP, inter-cluster distance also preserved well (ie Global Structure)

=> All the Optimization under TSNE & UMAP, are mostly Convex so they have
   multiple optima
   Therefor its Not a Deterministic
