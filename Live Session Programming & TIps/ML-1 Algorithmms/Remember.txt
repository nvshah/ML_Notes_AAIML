Remember

-> Learning Rate is used during Optimization Process

=> Forward/Backward Feature Selection is techniqye that is model-agnostic 
   (ie it can be used for any model)

* Most of the ML algo works base don some assumptions they made for their algorithm technique
  Eg
  Naive Bayes -> Conditional Probability
  KNN  -> Concept of Locality (ie Nearby points belong to same group)
  Logistic Reg -> Linearly Seperable (Almost)
