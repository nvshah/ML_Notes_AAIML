-----------

=> If dataset is small & if it meets some conditions, then
   Z-test & T-test are more better than permutation test

=> Your Test Statistic must be Sensible

=> CLT works for sample mean & it doesnt works for sample medians

=> Often T statistics follow the Normal distribution
=> For medians, we can use Permutation test

- Placebo Controlled Test

---------

Framework Steps

1. Data, task, Define H0, Ha carefully
2. Experiment
   Design/Use Sensible test statistic (T)
3. Using T & (H0, Ha) decide if its one-sided test or two-sided test

4. p-val := P(T is as extreme as T_obs|H0)
              |
              To do this you need distribution of test-statistics under Null hypothesis
   You need distb of T <=** MIMP

5. Significance Level (alpha)


* Permutation test vs (Z-Test, T-Test)
  ----------
  When your dataset is small & it meets some conditions, then Z-test or T-test is preferred
  but
  when your dataset us large & there are no assumptions then permutation test makes sense (ie is better)


* Z-Test (Standard Normal Variate)
  ------

  Assumptions (In Practice)
  -> If my Samples are known & if its reasonably large then we can estimate its standard deviation
     to population's standard deviation !

  => Test Statistics follow Z-distribution (ie Normal N(0, 1) Distb) under Null Hypothesis

  - 2 Sided Hypothesis Test


* T-test :
  -------
  - Often when < 30
  - When we have very little data & we cannot apply Z-test
  - When we dont know Population standard deviation

  (Eg Medicine is such area where you cannot have large test size because otherwise if we
      use large test than there is risk everyone can die)

  - we use Samples

  -> Test Statistics tends to follow t-distb (with degree of freedoms)

  Degree of Freedom
  -----------------
  (Degree of Freedoms is used generally when data is of small size
   because small size data can impact the distribution greatly)

  => When data is small, then very minor change can impact distribution easily

  => So when you have small data, DOF becomes relevant

  => Often DOF is a function

  => As DOF incr, T-distb becomes behaving alike Normal Distb (ie Z-distb)


* Compare Means ?? (which Test)
  -----------------
  If sample sizes are small :- T-test
  else :- Z-test


* Z-Proportional Test :
  -----------------
  - Instead of comparing means, the Z-Proportional Test compares the proportions

  -> Test statistics follows the Z-Distribution


Q) A/B Test vs Hypothesis Test ??
  ------
  A/B test :- helps to setup

  Hypothesis :- Helps to make a decision about reject or keep hypothesis
