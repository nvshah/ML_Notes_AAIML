Common Tests in Statistical Tests

1) Get the T_obs   // From Observed Experiments

2) Define the Null Hypothesis

3) Define the Alternative Hypothesis

4) Define the Test Statistics

   Decide which sided test you gonna perform ?
   i.e Left-Sided (One Sided)
       Right Sided

       Two-Sided

       -> Often this decision depends on the Alternative Hypothesis &
          Distribution of Test Stats given the Null Hypothesis

5) Compute P-val

   P-Val := As Extreme As T_Obs


* Test (Classical) :-

  T-test
