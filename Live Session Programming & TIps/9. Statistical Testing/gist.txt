REMEMBER :-
=> Test Statistics defines your P-val (Given Null & Alternative Hypothesis)

=> Always choose your null hypothesis that you can simulate (in case of Permutatation testing)
=> You must also consider the distribution of your Test-Statistics whilst choosing the Null Hypothesis

-> Generally alpha is choosen = 5%

=> Permutation test, we can use for median as well

-> ANOVA is a simpler version of Linear Regression !
   ANOVA is a special case of Linea Reg

   Linear Reg is a Generalization of ANOVA

-> The test of independence we perform are affectively measuring the Correlation (not causality)

Level of Significance


-----------------------------------------------------------------
Every Statistical Test will have following things
 - Test Statistics := used to determine the decision of the test-outcome
 - Null Hypothesis := H0  (default assumption)  | Environment 1
 - Alternative Hypothesis := Ha  (claimed assumption) | Environment 2

 - P-val := Distb of test stats helps to derive the p-val

=> To compute the p-val, you need to identify first which sided test would it be
   (ie left ended or right ended) based on the test stats distribution
   &
   then You need the T_obs inorder to find the p-val from it !
------------------------------------------------------------------


* Hypothesis Testing includes below things at its core :

  - Test Staistsics (You rely to come to decision)
  - P-Val (Computation that we carried out in such testing)
  - alpha (a benchmark to which p-val would be compared)

  -> Consider Distribution of Test-Statistics (IMP***)

  => You have to always think (whilst doing p-val)
   that if you are doing
   1 sided test or
   2 sided test
   depending on understanding what is your Null Hypothesis & What is your Alternative Hypothesis

* P-val :
  ----
  is all about Observing value as extrem as T_obs

  As extreme as values depends on the Alternative Hypothesis !
  &
  Also How T behaves under Null Hypothesis

* When to reject Null & not ? (2 Universe way Understanding)
  _________________________

  -> Let say there are 2 Universe
     1 of Null Hypothesis
     &
     another of an alternative hypothesis

     Now if you get very lower probability for your test statistics then your alpha (ie benchmark)
     then you dont want to live in the world where there are less chances !
     So
     Thus we reject the Null Hypothesis in such case
     &
     Move to another (ie alternative) Universe !

  REMEMBER :
  -> We are not questioning the ground truth
     We are just using the ground truth to conclude if alternative hypothesis is better or not


* Test Technique :
--------------
=> Z-test or T-test are more powerful when dataset is smaller & has some assumptions (ie it meets some conditions)
   Whereas
   Permutation Test is preferred when dataset is large & there is no assumptions


* Comparing K Groups of Data :- is what ANNOVA technique is used for


* Compare Means ?? (which Test)
  -----------------
  If sample sizes are small :- T-test
  else :- Z-test

=> For medians, we can use Permutation test
=> For comparing Proportions : Z-Proportional Test


* Chi-Squre Test :
  ----
  - Use to compare 2 categorical variables are independent or not !

* Degree of Freedoms:
  ----
  - terms is used when data is relatively small in size
  - think it as parameter of distribution

* Non-Parametric test:
  ------------
  -> When we say statistical tests is non-parametric we mean that
     It makes no assumption about the Population Distribution

  The fact that test is non-parametric means that it makes no assumption about population distribution

* Summary (Which Test to use when ??) | Big Picture


1. Z-test :
   If you want to compare Means of Obsv ie 2 Samples (let say Covid Drug1 or Drug2)
   &
   If you have Population Standard Deviation or
   Your samples are large enough that you can estimate population Standard Deviation

   Then You can use the Z-test

2. T-test:
   You are given 2 samples
   Sample sizes are small
   &
   You want to compare means of these 2 samples (ie Medicines 1 vs Medicines 2)

   As we do not have large samples we can end up using T-test

3. Z-Proportion Test
   If you want to compare ratios or proportions
   i.e like how many people purchase from my website as compare to number of people came to my website

   then you can consider Z-Proportion test (as long as you have more than 30 observations)


For all the above tests, it holds true based on CLT.
So their Population mean & standard deviation needs to be finite
&
All the obsv are random & independent

4. test of independence (Chi-Square Test)

   Eg Doesn gender impact purchase/premium subscription
   - It makes no assumptions
   - If you want to do test of independence !

5. ANOVA

   - If you want to compute or compare K-Group means
     &
     You know that each of group's population are Gaussian distributed
     & also have similar variances

     then you can use ANOVA

6. Konglomorov Smirnow test (KS-Test)

   -> If you want to compare 2 distribution

7. Permutation Resampling test :

   If you want to compare 99 Percentile of something
   or
   If you want to compare medians between groups
   then Permutation Resampling test is useful
