=> We cannot judge if some test is parametric or non-parametrix just only based on
   type of test-statistic distribution

=> Your Alternative Hypothesis & Test Statistics define the P-val formulation

=> You have to always think (whilst doing p-val)
   that if you are doing
   1 sided test or
   2 sided test
   depending on understanding what is your Null Hypothesis & What is your Alternative Hypothesis

=> Always choose your null hypothesis that you can simulate

=> We must know & consider the Distribution of Test-Statistiscs
_____________

* Test (Classical) :-
  Z-test,
  T-test
  Z-Proportional test,
  ChiSquare Test
  ANOVA

* Test Statistic :
  - Something we measure during our experiment
  - Test Statistic is sensible
  - Its behavior (ie val) may vary as per null hypothesis or Alternative Hypothesis

* Null Hypothesis :
  ----
  You select Null Hypothesis in such a way that
  either
  a. You can simulate the null hypothesis & can get the test statistics
  or
  b. You have the Distribution of the Test-Statistics

  Ultimately you want some info in terms of Test-Statistics (maybe it is via value or distribution form)

* P-Val :
  ----
  You have 2 main things
  1) T_obs (ie already observed stats that is independent)
  2) Null Hypothesis

  Now when you predict the T_obs given null hypothesis then it will be called as p-val
  & This phenomenon is called as Hypothesis Testing

  Eg If Coin is Fair (ie our Null Hypothesis), then P(head) = 1/2
     Now
     Given this (Fair Coin) what is probability that Coin will turn 65 times head in 100 experiments/trials

[REMEMBER]
 => Test-Statistics follows the Distribution type
    &
    Under Null Hypothesis, we know the Test-Statistics so we can use the Mathematical Machinery


* When to reject Null & not ?
-------------------------
  -> Let say there are 2 Universe
     1 of Null Hypothesis
     &
     another of an alternative hypothesis

     Now if you get very lower probability for your test statistics then your alpha (ie benchmark)
     then you dont want to live in the world where there are less chances !
     So
     Thus we reject the Null Hypothesis in such case
     &
     Move to another (ie alternative) Universe !

    By default at first we choose to live in Null Hypothesis World
    & once the p-val is < the significance (alpha), we decide to reject the Null-Hypothesis (World)
    & accept the alternative one !

* KS Test :
  ------
  -> Non-Parametric test
  In KS test, the test statistics follow a Konglomorov distribution


* Permutation Test :
  ------
  -> Non Parametric test
  -> We do not have theortical distribution of test-statistic

=> Formulation of p-val depends on an alternative hypothesis & test-statistics



* Left Sided test :
  Right Sided Test
  2 Sided Test

  P-val formulation for either of type of test depends on alternative hypothesis

  You have 2 things
    a. Null Hypothesis (H0)
    b. Alternative Hypothesis (Ha)

  So normally while computing the Test-Statistics via
  Plotting PDF (ir Graph)
  Null Hypothesis Lies on one end (ie let say Left)
  &
  Alternative Hypothesis lies on other end (ie. let say Right)

  This wont be always the case but often the case
  Sometimes
  Alternative Hypothesis includes both the end (ie Eg >= & <= conditions at same time !)

2 Sided Test
=> Most often those are symmetric 2 sided test
=> Non-Symmetric 2 Sided test are unique cases

* P-val & alpha :
  ---
  You compare your p-val with the alpha
  if it is less :- then you reject null hypothesis
  else :- reject alternative hypothesis

=> For null hypothesis you must use such case where your probability is definitive !
=> Always choose your null hypothesis that you can simulate

______

* KS Test :
  ------
  - Generally used to compare 2 distb (similarity)
  - Konglomorov Distb

  Test Statistics :- Suprememum of absolute value of the Gap !

  NOTE :- If both the distb overlap completely. i.e similar almost
          thus test-statistics (ie supremum gap = 0)
