NORMALIZAION:
Data normalization is the process of rescaling one or more features to the range of 0 to 1.
This means that the largest value for each feature is 1 and the smallest value is 0.
Normalization is a good technique to use when you do not know the distribution of your data
or when you know the distribution is not Gaussian (a bell curve).
Normalization is useful when your data has varying scales and the algorithm you are using does not make assumptions
about the distribution of your data Standardization: Data standardization is the process of rescaling one or more features
so that they have a mean value of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Standardization
assumes that your data has a Gaussian (bell curve) distribution. This does not strictly have to be true,
but the technique is more effective if your feature distribution is Gaussian.
Standardization is useful when your data has varying scales and the algorithm you are using does make
assumptions about your data having a Gaussian distribution
