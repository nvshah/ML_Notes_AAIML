2. Attrib Model in Marketing Part 2
----------------

-> The linear Reg Model are Additive

=> The problem with Shapely value is its exponential time complexity

=> All is about tradeoff between Complexity & Rigorous
- Transition Matrix
=> Simple Markov Model will ignore Timer Series !

-> Historical Data Analyzing is done Iteratively & Not once
-> Intent is easily captured whilst searching

----------

1. Game Theoritic   (SOTA)
2. ML-based
3. Markov- Chain  (Classical Stats)
4. Survival Analysis (Classical Stats)

NOTE :
  number of states (#states) = number of channels


* Markov Chains :
  ----------
  - Graph
  - Transition Probabilities

  Property :- `MemoryLess`

  MemoryLess :
   -> Going to next stage depends only on previous stage & not all previous states
   -> Conditional Probability on previous state (not all previous states)
   -> History dont matter
   -> Simplify the math | Simplifying assumption (ie every state depends on prev state only)
   -> Easier to tackle

  Removal Effect :
    - Overall (with focused State) - Conversations (without focused State)

  Drawback of Markvo Chains :
    - Memoryless assumption
    - less regorous


* `Markov Chains` vs `Shapely Values` :
  ---
  => Tradeoff between Computation Complexity & Mathematic Rigour

  Markov Chains are Computationally less Complex/expensive whereas they are less mathematically rigorous
  on the other side
  Shapely Values are Computationally more Complex but they are more mathematically rigorous

  Shapely Values := Mathematically very rigorous technique

  -> Markvo Chains are kinda similar to Naive Bayes

  * Cyclic Purchase Channel/Probability & Thresold :
    ---
    -> You can define some thresold after which you can stop proceeding furthers (ie for eg stop showing ads)
       thresold can be some probability val (for Eg 1e-6)


* Survival Analysis For Attribution :
  ------------
  - primarily was created in Health Care Domain

  - Healthcare Analytics
    Eg survival of patient

  * Survival Function := 1 - PDF
    ---
     As time passes, prob of patient being not alive increases

  * Hazard Function :
    ---
    -> What is happening to patient in small time (isnatnt of time) after some time T
    -> You can represent Hazard Func as a Survival Func

       - S`(t)/ S(t)

* Survival Analysis :
  ---
  - Ding Univariate plot for Survival Analysis

  - Organic Search vs Paid Search


* Cox (Proportional Hazard Regression Models)
  ---------
  - Multiplicative Linear (Additive) Model
