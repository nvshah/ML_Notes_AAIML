---------------------

=> The attribution modelling is Marketting Decision Drive

-> Sales are also called Conversion in Marketing Terms
-> The problem with more complex model is to Quantify the Interpretation

-> Except Game Theory all other things (including ML) is approximation
   Only Game theory is Solid Non-Refutable approach

-> To get the data you need to do Experiment & A/B testing (initially)

------------------------------

* Attribution Modelling :

  (Multi Channel Attribution)
  (Marketting Mix Modelling)

  Multi Channel Attribute :
  -> There are multiple channels & whom should I attribute to ?


* Digital Marketing :

  - Ad Click
  - Ad Impressions  // shown an ads
  - Search Ads
  - Display Ads  // shown to you based on past behavior or demographic data

* Traditional Marketing :

  - TV ads
  - Print Press ads

* Outdoor Marketing :

  - Banners
  - Hoardings

* Digital Channels :

  Channel :- trhough which you generate sales

  - email   // ecommerce
  - Google search
  - others...


* Attribution :
  -----
  - How much does Ads/Channels contribute to final purchase
    or
    How much does purchase is attributed by particular channel

  -> This is non-trivial problem ?

* Rule based vs Data Driven System :
  -----

  Some Considerations :-

  - Last Interaction
  - Last Non-direct Click
  - Last Google ads Click
  - First interaction


* Granularity of Attribution :
  ----
  - Per sale/conversion driven
  - or across some interval

    Weekly/daily/hourly Granularity


* Regression based Marketing Mix Model :
  --------

=> As long as We can get the Feature importance score, that model is useful !

* Model Agnostic Feature Imp Score
  - LIME
  - SHAP

-> Be Careful of :- Seasonality Features

* Carry-Over Effect :
  -------------
  Time gap between ads & sales

=> Problem with ML approach is Feature Importance is not very useful & appropriate


* Game Theory
  ------------
  -> Most solid way (when you have more data)

  - Shapely Values   // Rigorous Economical Maths & proven mathematically


* Co-operative Games :
  -----
  - Each Channel as a player
  - All of them simulataneous work to achieve the sales

  Characteristic Function :
  ----
  -> Map Coaliation to a Real number
  -> Value generated by Coaliation (Group of Channel)  // in marketting
  - Total #Conversion/Sales generated

  Shapely Value :-
   - How much attribution to give to channel i for this sale/conversion is the shapely value
   - How much credit to give to channel i given some characteristic function
