=> Not every distb can be convert to Normal

=> Monte Carlo Simulations is mostly used when you have uncertainity in
   your inputs

-------------

* Monte Carlo Idea came from Physicians



* Common Example :
  - Estimate value of PI using randomization

* What does Monte Carlo Simulation means ??
  -> To its nearest it is `Stochastic Simulation`

     Stochastic := Probabilistic
      \
      to arrive to a result (computtaionally)

* Key Aspects :
  ---
  - uncertainty in inputs (ie so we have distribution of it)
  - ability to sample from input distributions
  - As the input is uncertain (Random Variable) so Output will be likewise (ie Random Variable)


* How to sample from given input distributions (Which are not Known)
  - One Idea is Proportional Sampling !

* Inverse Transform Sampling :
  ------------------------
  - Help to sample

* Monte Carlo Simulations Application
  ----------------
  -> There can be some certain & some uncertain variables

  1.  Logistic & Supply Chain :
  - Some of random variables may be Certain

  2. Manufacturing :

  3. Trading (Finance)

* Application (Monte Carlo)
  Q) When Monte Carlo ??

  -> As long as you have uncertainties in input variable &
     As long as you have mapping func between inp & out in given domain


* What when Inverese Func are not avail ?

  -> You can use emperical CDF
  -> else you can use MCMC  (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)
