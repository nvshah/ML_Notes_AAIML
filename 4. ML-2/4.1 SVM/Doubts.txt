Doubts 

Q) Why in Dual Form There is no mention of Weights & Bias but only alpha (or lemma i.e Langrange Multiplier )
   ??

[REMEMBER]
   In Dual Problem Formulation

   The Only variable we are concern about solving is lemma or alpha
   because
   The weight & bias depends on lemma or alpha (post constrained optimized form) for its optimal val directly
   Thus
   If we have optimal lemma or alpha, we can easily compute the optimal weight & optimal bias

   So we do not need Gradient Descent to compute the optimal weights & optimal bias
   as both depends directly on optimal lemma

   So we just need to put efforts to find optimal lemma or alpha
   This efforts may be led tp Gradient Descent or any other optimization techniqye to find best alpha/lemma
