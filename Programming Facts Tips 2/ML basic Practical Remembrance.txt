ML basic Practical Remembrance


=> Whilst doinng programming with Colab + Google Drive :
    - Do store your intermediaate result as pickle files on Google Drive (as Backup) in case if Colab dies you won't loose your code & foundings.

* Feature Transform Preprocessinng

  Categorical :- One Hot Encoding
                 get_dummies    // alternative to one hot encoding
                 
                 CountVectorizer   // Convert data-point into numerical array in simple 


  Numerical :- Standardization
               Normalization | MinMaxScaler

               MinMaxScalar = Normalizationn with l1-norm

[MetaData & Models]
=> Every Model will have the MetaData File (ie most probably json file)
       \
        that stores the info such as Weight, Featires,...

* Solving | Optimizers :
  - LogisticRegression() & SGDClassifier(loss=log)
  - LinearRegression() & SGDRegressor(

* Logistic Reg & Grid Search CV
   -> Need to make sure that best alpha (ie Regularized param) is in logspace

   Why LogSpace ??
   -> To get val in logspace means
      - to get value where 10**(n), base 10 is already applied

   -> How it will help ?
      - So that we can get varied value of Regularization Parameter
      - Thus helps to get robust regularization param in less time (as compare to LinSpace)
