* ROC & AUC (Mine Understanding)
  ----------
  -> Used esp for Binary Classif (0-1)

  - Now in realtime we dont get exact ans in terms of 0-1,
    Often we get the probabilities (ie between 0-1)

    So now we need to approximate the prediction either 0 or 1 from probability
    |
    For this we need some thresold ie to determine & so that we can compare
    our probability with this thresold to decide either class is 0 or 1

  -> ROC is all about experimenting with the different thresolds
     |
     & Then with these trial & error we need to learn the behavior of model
       based on accumulated observations from above experiments

       FPR, TPR for each experiment is useful in deducing the
