Q) What is Diff between { TFIDF, BOW } & {Word2Vec, Glove} ??

   -> TFIDF, BOW :- Accounts Local Context &
                    Find Features accordingly
                    & They provide then numeric/decimal val to those features for each sentence
                      (Which we called it Weights ie TFIDF Weights to each words)

   -> Word2Vec, Glove :
       |
       -> here Global context is accounted (alongwith local context)
          +
          So Vector for each word is discovered (either via Word2Vec & GLOVE)
          &
          then if we need to account Local context info then we can provide
          the weights to those vector representation via either {TFIDF, BOW}
