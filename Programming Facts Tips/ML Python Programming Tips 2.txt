ML Python Programing Tips 2

* To get best thresold outa GridSearch or RandomSearch ;- 
	Best params :- result.cv_results_['params'][result.best_index_] OR result.best_params_

	Best mean score :- result.cv_results_['mean_test_score'][result.best_index_] OR result.best_score_

	Best std :- result.cv_results_['std_test_score'][result.best_index_]


* Data can be present in 2 forms mostly :-
    1) Sqlite
    2) Csv files
    3) hdf files (HDFStore)

=> You can store your experimentation/findings in intermediate results files
   So that you dont need to perform same computation !

   You can store such results findings in files such as pickles/ hdf

* Other formats
  ---
   - hdf format // hierarchical



=> slmultilearn only uses dense matrix & not sparse matrix

=! Always do Sanity Checks

=> Do use LogSpace for finding HyperParam (ie like Regularization Param)
   [Eg Logistic Regression + Grid Search => Here you can use np.logspace() for 'C' param]


* You can perform standardization & model declaration in 1 step via
  make_pipeline()
