Math Notes (Linera algebra)

* Equation of Lines 

   - Slope-Intercept Form
   - 

* In statistics you need to make assumptionns to move further in derivations


* Derivative & Optimization
  ---
   Derivative = 0 => minima, maxima or saddle point


* Quadratic Optimization is complex and harder than Simple Linear Optimization
   |
   When unknown terms are Quadratic (Squared), then it is called Quadratic Optimization
