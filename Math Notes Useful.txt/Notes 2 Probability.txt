Simple Independence 
Conditional Independence

Standard Deviation is influence by Outliers a Lot
While MAD is less influence by an Outliers


* Exponential Distb (Eg)
  ----
   Time it takes between your phone calls ie at t1 & next at t2 is often represented by exponential distb

=> In statistics you need to make assumptionns to move further in derivations

REMEMBER
=> Central Limit Theorem is Theorem of Nature. Its not used to test if something is Normal or not !


* Binomial & Poisson :
  ----
  Poisson :- #Events per unit time

  So When n is so large in Binomial, we can say its Poisson if probability remanisn constant in each trial

  -> Poisson is approximation to Binomial (when n is large)
     |
     Hence Poisson makes sense when n is too large in Binomial Distb
     Where in such case only we need to approximate the Binomial Distb
