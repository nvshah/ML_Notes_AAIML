* SageMaker vs EC2 :
  -----\
  EC2 -> provides you a virtual Box (Raw Compute), basic things
  SageMaker -> Orchestrates everything needed for ML (internally does Virtual Box acquiring things)


* Azure ML is alternative to AWS Sagemaker


* Normal Steps :

  Data -> Pre-Proc -> Hyper-Param -> Model

* Estimator is for Model
  Processor is for PreProcessing

* Elastic Kubernetes Service | Elastic Container Service

* Serverless Compue -> Amazon Lambda

=> Master Nodes & Worker Nodes
   Master Node is considered as 0


* AutoScale vs Elasticity


* Random/Grid Search vs Bayesian Optimisation :
  ----
  -> Unlike Random/Grid Search What Bayesian Optimisation does is it consider previous
     Experiment & some bayes theorem to pick next candidate for Hyper-Parameter
