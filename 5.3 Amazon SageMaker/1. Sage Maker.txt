=> Using SageMaker You can speedup your Idea -> Product

___________

=? End-to-End ML platform on Amazon
   - Data acquistion
   - Data preparation
   - Data Analysis
   - Modeling
   - Deploy/Productionization
   - Monitoring

* On-Premise ML

  - You will get prepaired on cloud

* Tool :- KubeFlow is a tool for End to End ML (if you dont want to use SageMaker)

Journey :- OnPremise -> Cloud + Tools

* Amazon SageMaker Studoio

=> SageMaker internally uses S3 & EC2 extensively

* EC2 :-
  - Virtual Machines

* S3 :-
  - Buckets
  - Distributed Disk Management

* boto :-
  - library to work on AWS administrative works

=> Whenever you do some work in studio, store your work in S3,
   because Virtual Box allocated to you will not preserve the State or your code

   Create S3 bucket for permanent Storage
      \
       -> Store & Folder/File Structure

* SageMaker vs EC2 :
  -----\
  EC2 -> provides you a virtual Box (Raw Compute)
  SageMaker -> Orchestrates everything for ML (internally does Virtual Box things)

* KubeFlow :-
  ---
  -> If you want to migrate your codebase in future then you can use KubeFlow
     For Eg migrate to GCP cloud
            migrate to Azure Cloud
