---------------------------

AWS -> Everything that gets permanently stored will be in S3

=> Docker Container will be killed after the Job is done !
   So anything you want to persist should be moved to S3 as well

Container := new Compute Component

=> transformer() is terminology used in sagemaker for Inferencing

SageMaker Terminology  <--

For Inferencing => transformer
    Training => Estimator
    PreProcessing => processor

------------

* Data Wrangler
  - From multiple resources

* Containerization & Docker :
  ---
  - Modern Strategy to create compute resources on the fly
  - More Compute Resources & More Ram


1> PreProcess Data using Containers

2> Experiments :
   - collection of processing & training jobs related to a project

   - multiple trials
     each trial :- Data -> Pre-Proc -> HyperParam -> Model

   Tracking :
   ---
   - Its imp to keep track of params & what data you are using !

   Trial :
   ----

   -> When you do fit() then sagemaker will spawn new container (ie via Docker)
      inorder to train the Model seperately (ie Compute seperatley)


* Images :
  ---
  Linux img or any other thing we want on our Compute ie Container


* Batch Inference :
  ---

* Real time Inference :
  ---
  - Deploy as realtime API's
  - Elastic Inference

* AWS Model Endpoint :
  ---
  - Endpoint Configuration


* Docker :
  ---
  - You can spinoff Virtual Instances just via Config files
