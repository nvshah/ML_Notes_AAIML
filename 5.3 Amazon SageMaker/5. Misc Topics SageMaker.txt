5. Misc Topics SageMaker
---------------------
ref : https://sagemaker-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sagemaker-spark/index.html


-> Most of ML things are implemented in Sagemaker via a components

-> For Distributed System - you can use Redis/MemCache

=> SageMaker is a tooling to simplify the things of SDE, DEVOPS, Admin,...

1. Ground Truth (Data Labeling)
-------
   Various Subtasks :- Bounding Boxes, Labels, Tagging, Segmentation

   - Auto Labelling
   - Active Learning

   -> 3D Point Cloud is used for Autonomous Driving

     - Iphone Front Face Camera uses 3D Map of your face (internally it uses 3D Point cloud)
       to detect real You

     - Can be used to detect object in traffic (via Segmentation)


* Auto ML/ Auto Pilot:
  ----
  -> Auto Pilot is Auto ML tech provide by Sagemaker

  -> Auto ML tries to do Basic things (ie First Cut Solution)
  -  Helps you to get start with some rough baseline model

* Neural Archi Search (DL Model algo)
  ----
  Hyper param in DL can be describe as a Neural Archi Search !

  -> Whole Network archi is itself a Hyper-Parameter

  - It could not invent new DL archi but can enhance the existing one (like CNN, Transformer)

  NAS is still in research Area & getting limelight now a days


* Feature Store :
  ----
  - Distributed Key-Value Store for Feature Engineering (ie Feature Vectors worked by diff teams)
    |
    Some thing generated by team for their usecase
    which can be later used or enhance by other team for their usecase

    For this purpose the Feature Store is introduced

  - Other Services around it
    Encryption, Pipelining, Tooling

  - Product2Vec, Everything2Vec

* Augmented AI :
  ------------

* SageMaker Clarify :
  ---
  - Explainability of a Model & Fairness of a Model

  SHAP :
  ---
  -> Model Agnostic way for Model Explainability
  - Concepts of Game Theory
  - Mathematical Gurantee (ie Rigorous)
  - Solid Rigorous Gurantee (Mathematically)

* Data Wrangler :
  ------
  - helps to import data from diff sources (ie CSV, S3, ...)
